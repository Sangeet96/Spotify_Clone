# Spotify Clone
This project is an operational replica of the widely-used music streaming platform, Spotify. Constructed utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides fundamental features such as:
Playback Controls: Enable users to manage music seamlessly by providing options to play, pause, skip to the next track, and go back to the previous track.
Playlists: You have the option to choose a playlist based on your mood and listen to songs from it.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Organizes the basic framework of the web application.
CSS is responsible for styling the interface elements, resulting in an enjoyable and visually appealing experience.
JavaScript enhances the interactivity of the application and allows for the manipulation of its behavior, facilitating control over playback and administration of playlists.

Learning Outcomes: 
Front-End Development Fundamentals: I have acquired a comprehensive comprehension of the fundamental web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and their interaction in constructing user interfaces.
DOM Manipulation: I have acquired the knowledge and skills to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript in order to dynamically modify the content of the application. This includes implementing dynamic playback controls and playlist interactions.
Event Handling: I explored the process of capturing user events, such as button clicks, and modifying the application's behavior accordingly to control the playback experience.
Project Planning & Execution: I have acquired significant expertise in the process of strategizing and implementing a web development project, which encompasses tasks such as structuring code, conducting testing, and potentially utilizing version control.
